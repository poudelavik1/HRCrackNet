"""Download the pretrained weights of an encoder into the local cache, or check that they are there.

Compute nodes cannot download, so the weights must be cached from the login node
(scripts/setup_conda.sh runs this). With HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 in the environment nothing is
downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub: the call then succeeds only if the weights are cached,
which is how scripts/submit.sh and the jobs use it. The encoder is built as the network builds
it (HRNet with the outputs of its four branches).
